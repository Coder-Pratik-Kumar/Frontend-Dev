  <h1>The Art of Typography</h1>
  <p>
    <mark>Typography</mark> is not just about choosing a font; it's about creating harmony in design. 
    The balance of <strong>weight</strong>, <em>spacing</em>, and alignment determines readability and impact.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every designer must understand how <strong>font families</strong> work together. 
    From serif classics to clean sans-serifs, each has its own personality. 
    A well-styled paragraph can transform simple text into a meaningful experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    Proper <em>line-height</em> and <mark>letter-spacing</mark> can make even long passages easy on the eyes. 
    Typography is the invisible art that shapes how readers feel about words.
